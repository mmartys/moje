IE hacking:
=========
width:20px;#width:23px:_width:20px;
FF applies the first width; IE7 applies the second one and IE6 applies the third one. This method works on all the CSS attributes too.

div {
zoom: 1 ;
}

* {position: relative; zoom: 1;}

legendary vertical-align for div:
====
For other elements, aligning the contents of a box vertically in the middle of the it can be a bit of a fine art. There are several techniques:
1) Use display:table-cell; to make the element simulate a table cell, and then use vertical-align. This works, but may have unintended consequences (there are other attributes of table cells that you may not want to simulate).
2) For single lines of text, simply make the line-height the same as the height of the entire box. You probably won't even need vertical-align for this.
3) If you know the height of the element you want to vertically align, you can position it to 50% minus half its height, like this:

position:absolute;
top:50%;
height:200px;
margin-top:-100px; /* half the height */
